Hello World! This is my very first project built while following **The Odin Project** course. 

It's a simple **recipe website**, created using **HTML**. The goal of the project is to practice and demonstrate my skills in this language by: 

- Linking pages with <a> elements
- Using lists <ul> and <ol> to organize the content
- Using different headings elements
- Practice folder organization and git control
