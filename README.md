Hello World! This is my very first project built while following **The Odin Project** course. 

It's a simple **recipe website**, created using **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal of the project is to practice and demonstrate my skills on those languages by: 

- Linking pages with **a** elements
- Using **lists** ul and **ol** to organize the content
- Using different headings elements
- Practice folder organization and git control
- Add CSS basic properties like: width, height, color, padding, margin
- Use pseudo-classes to give **a** elements different behaviors
